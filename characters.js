    'about': 'Krillin (クリリン Kuririn) is a supporting protagonist in the Dragon Ball series. He\'s one of the most powerful and talented martial artists on Earth. He is courageous, faithful, and good-natured. Krillin had a brief rivalry with Goku when they first trained under Master Roshi, but they quickly became lifelong best friends, to the point that Goku cares for him as much as his family and closest ones. He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies. His short stature and baldness (with the exception of when he grows out his hair in the Majin Buu Saga onwards, although he occasionally shaves his head in several sagas in Dragon Ball Super) aid him in his ability to provide comic relief during tense moments. During the latter half of Dragon Ball Z, he largely retires from fighting, opting to settle down with his family instead, becoming the husband of Android 18 and the father of Marron. However, because of all things that occur during the Golden Frieza Saga, he returns to his lifestyle as a warrior later on in Dragon Ball Super.',

Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth. He would later repeatedly fight alongside Universe 7\'s most powerful warriors in order to protect Earth and his family, as well as to surpass Goku in power. Vegeta\'s character development is the most praised and one of the biggest in the series. He started off serving as the main antagonist of the Vegeta Saga, but then as an anti-heroic tritagonist throughout the rest of Dragon Ball Z. After the Majin Buu Saga Vegeta would evolve into a hero as the main deuteragonist/secondary protagonist of the sequel series, Dragon Ball Super.',

Therefore, the two Trunks had completely different lives (as opposed to those who lived before the Time Machines arrived, who lived exactly the same lives as their counterparts until the point at which the two timelines diverge, three years before the androids arrived). Well-mannered, serious and very cautious, Trunks hails from an alternate timeline in which Future Androids 17 and 18 murdered the Dragon Team and proceeded to create an apocalyptic anarchy on Earth. Trunks is trained by Future Gohan as a teenager and becomes a gifted fighter, swordsman and a Super Saiyan, which are traits that aid him greatly in the battle against the Androids after traveling back in time in order to save his own future.',

    'about': 'Kid Buu (魔人ブウ（純粋） Majin Bū (Junsui), lit. "Demon Person Boo (Pure)") is the original, pure form of Majin Buu. Unlike his other forms, this form of Buu\'s thought process is seen to be irrational and spontaneous, even destroying his own body to destroy the Earth. Although he appears smaller than any other form, he is more dangerous than any other forms of Buu due to his full relentless evil and unpredictability. He is also completely free of restraint and has no trace of sanity and, because of this, is extremely volatile. He retains his childish personality, becoming amused and laughing hysterically at his own destruction of entire worlds. He is the main antagonist for the Kid Buu Saga, the final antagonist of the Majin Buu Saga, and the overall final antagonist of Dragon Ball Z.',

    'about': 'Grandpa Son Gohan (孫悟飯じいさん Son Gohan Jīsan, Japanese pronunciation: [sõŋgohãɲʥiːsãɴ]) is a martial artist who was Master Roshi\'s number one pupil. He is the adoptive grandfather of Goku. Due to being accidentally killed by a rampaging Great Ape Goku before the start of the Dragon Ball series, he does not fully debut until his disguised appearance as "The Mysterious Fifth Man" alongside Fortuneteller Baba\'s other fighters, where he temporarily reunites with Goku. In anime filler, he currently holds a position as Annin\'s attendant and bodyguard of the Furnace of Eight Divisions. Grandpa Gohan is responsible for giving Son Goku his Earth name and serves as an important mentor and parent figure in his life, being firstly responsible for Goku\'s kindhearted and heroic nature. His legacy runs deep through his adoptive grandson\'s family, as Goku\'s son Gohan was named in honor of him.',
