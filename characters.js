    'about': 'Krillin (クリリン Kuririn) is a supporting protagonist in the Dragon Ball series. He\'s one of the most powerful and talented martial artists on Earth. He is courageous, faithful, and good-natured. Krillin had a brief rivalry with Goku when they first trained under Master Roshi, but they quickly became lifelong best friends, to the point that Goku cares for him as much as his family and closest ones. He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies. His short stature and baldness (with the exception of when he grows out his hair in the Majin Buu Saga onwards, although he occasionally shaves his head in several sagas in Dragon Ball Super) aid him in his ability to provide comic relief during tense moments. During the latter half of Dragon Ball Z, he largely retires from fighting, opting to settle down with his family instead, becoming the husband of Android 18 and the father of Marron. However, because of all things that occur during the Golden Frieza Saga, he returns to his lifestyle as a warrior later on in Dragon Ball Super.',

He is the descendant of Chilled, the youngest son of King Cold, the younger brother of Cooler and the father of Kuriza. Considered Goku\'s greatest foe and archnemesis, he has made several comebacks since his fight with Goku on Namek, including multiple invasions of Earth. He was chosen to represent Universe 7 as the tenth member of Team Universe 7 for the Tournament of Power as a replacement for Good Buu. This makes him the most recurring villain of the Dragon Ball series. After the events of the Tournament of Power, he was brought back to life as a reward, recovering his title as Emperor of Universe 7.',
