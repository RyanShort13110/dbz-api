    'about': 'Krillin („ÇØ„É™„É™„É≥ Kuririn) is a supporting protagonist in the Dragon Ball series. He\'s one of the most powerful and talented martial artists on Earth. He is courageous, faithful, and good-natured. Krillin had a brief rivalry with Goku when they first trained under Master Roshi, but they quickly became lifelong best friends, to the point that Goku cares for him as much as his family and closest ones. He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies. His short stature and baldness (with the exception of when he grows out his hair in the Majin Buu Saga onwards, although he occasionally shaves his head in several sagas in Dragon Ball Super) aid him in his ability to provide comic relief during tense moments. During the latter half of Dragon Ball Z, he largely retires from fighting, opting to settle down with his family instead, becoming the husband of Android 18 and the father of Marron. However, because of all things that occur during the Golden Frieza Saga, he returns to his lifestyle as a warrior later on in Dragon Ball Super.',
